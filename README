## Introduction
Our project focuses on designing a *syringe pump* for medical applications. The device is intended to deliver precise volumes of fluids at controlled rates, crucial in treatments such as IV therapy and medication infusion. Key features include:
- *Adjustable flow rates* for various medical needs.
- *User-friendly interface* for medical professionals.
- *Compact design* for portability.

## Flow Chart
The operational workflow of the syringe pump is depicted below:
